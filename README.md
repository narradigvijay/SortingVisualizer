Sorting Visualizer
Sorting Visualizer is an interactive web application developed to demonstrate the inner workings of fundamental sorting algorithms. This project was built using React as a means to deepen my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving while creating an educational tool for others interested in data structures and algorithms.

The visualizer provides a real-time, animated representation of how different sorting algorithms operate. It includes implementations of Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort, each presented with clear, step-by-step animations. These visualizations help users better understand the logic behind each algorithm by highlighting comparisons, swaps, and the overall flow of execution.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a practical and visual learning experience. The tool combines theoretical knowledge with visual feedback, making abstract concepts more intuitive. For instance:

Merge Sort demonstrates recursive array division and merging.

Quick Sort visualizes the use of pivot elements and partitioning.

Heap Sort shows the binary heap structure and sorting process.

Bubble Sort illustrates the basic concept of adjacent comparisons and swaps.

This application is designed to support learners at various levels, from beginners seeking clarity on sorting concepts to more advanced users looking to reinforce their understanding. It also serves as a showcase of how React can be effectively used to build dynamic and responsive educational interfaces.

The project architecture is modular, leveraging Reactâ€™s component-based structure, and emphasizes readability and maintainability in code.
